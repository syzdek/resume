@node Summary of Qualifications
@unnumberedsubsec Summary of Qualifications

@itemize @bullet
@item Possess expertise in creating portable programs and libraries through the use of development tools such as GCC, autoconf, libtool, and automake.
@item Solid understanding of Unix environments such as Slackware Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and OS X.
@item Experience in developing Unix daemons which incorporate Signal handling, process forking, logging, PID file management, chroot environments, and threads.
@item Strong knowledge of LDAP design including the deployment of Sun One Directory Server and OpenLDAP servers, the integration with applications, and schema development.
@end itemize


@c The objective of this resume is to obtain a position as a unix software developer and Linux systems administrator that utilizes my five years of Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD administration experience, software development experience, and infrastructure design experience.

@c I have experience with successfully migrating legacy, stand alone, and acquired Unix based systems into unified or updated core systems.  This experience includes e-mail migrations and upgrades, web server migrations, radius migrations, and DNS migrations.  I also have experience designing, developing, and implementing various user interfaces for interacting with support databases or provisioning systems.  These interfaces have used combinations of XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl, Bash, M4 and C. Working with remote Unix like operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris, I have had to develop management scripts and daemons to simplify or completely automate tasks. I have experience using open source development tools such as GNU automake, GNU autoconf, GNU libtool, GNU Compiler Collection, Concurrent Versioning System, and Revision Control System. I also have limited experience with commercial development tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio and Apple Xcode.  For most of my professional career I have had to be resourceful, self motivated, flexible, and self educated.

@item Developed a provisioning system which allows multiple billing systems to provision services on shared LDAP entries.  This system allows an individual subcriber to have one shared set of credentials for services managed managed by different billing systems.
@item Wrote a library and client which implemented the Over-the-air Service Provisioning Protocol, a proprietary protocol developed by Logica intended to allow clients on TCP/IP networks to communicate with mobile phones.  The client is used by an IVR to activate new mobile phones and update Preferred Roaming Lists (PRL) of existing mobile phones.
@item Wrote miscellaneous web interfaces for managing MMS, WAP, and EVDO service provisioning.
@item Wrote a library and utility that creates NAM data blocks for either IS-683-A or IS-683-C compatible mobile phones.

@item Developed Unix tools using Perl, Bash, and C to simplify server management and to assist technical support personnel.
@item Developed multiple Perl CGI interfaces which allowed staff controlled access to LDAP data and radius data.
@item Developed an iPlanet Messenger Express plug-in using CGI scripting and JavaScript. The plug-in added the ability for subscribers to manage e-mail filters. This involved writing a basic Sieve rule parser in JavaScript.
@item Completed a user audit of an acquired company's provisioning systems against the company's billing database. Services were provisioned using Unix passwd and shadow files and the billing information was stored in MS SQL databases.
@item Planned and executed an upgrade of an iPlanet Messaging Server that served roughly 65,000 users. The upgrade including moving from a Sun 4400 to a Sun V880, moving the message store from NFS shares to local arrays, and upgrading the software from version 5.1 to version 5.2.  Detailed plans, time lines accurate to the minute, and proof of repetitive testing was provided to management prior to the actual upgrade.
@item Planned and executed the migration of an acquired ISP (MosquitoNet) consisting of roughly 6,000 users into ACS's ISP infrastructure.  This included coordinated e-mail, web, FTP, DNS, and radius migrations.
@item Implemented a FTP infrastructure that uses LDAP for authentication and supports virtual domains.  Created custom LDAP schema to support infrastructure.
@item Developed a system that uses data from LDAP and local templates to dynamically provision and re-provision virtual domains.
@item Was primary administrator for DNS servers, iPlanet Messaging Servers, LDAP servers, and Unix web servers of the ISP business unit.
