Professional Experience
-----------------------

Bindle Binaries
     Anchorage, Alaska
     Owner-Operator/Software Developer (2010 - present)
     Primary responsibilities include writing software for the iPhone
     platform and Unix based platforms.  Secondary responsibilities
     include coordinating work with clients to ensure project
     satisfaction.
        - Designed and implemented an Objective-C framework for
          accessing LDAP directories from Mac OS X or iOS.

        - Built and maintained a server environment to support business
          operations. The server environment utilizes a combination of
          Linux containers (LXC) hosted  on local hardware and remote
          instances hosted with VPS providers.

        - Designed and wrote Branches, an LDAP administrator for iOS.
          Branches parses a servers schema and uses the parsed schema
          to present intelligent options to users when modifying LDAP
          entries.

        - Created a portable ODBC client using iODBC and unixODBC for
          POSIX environments such as OS X, Slackware Linux, and FreeBSD.

        - Created iOSPorts project to port OpenSSL, Cyrus-SASL,
          OpenLDAP, and PCRE to iOS environment for the iPhone.

        - Wrote a two-part article describing a method to port OpenLDAP
          to iOS.

        - Developed an RPN calculator for the iPhone OS. The
          application makes use of the CoreGraphics framework to
          dynamically generate button images used in the calculator's
          GUI.

        - Wrote a promotion iPhone application for Blogography.  The
          application makes use of the CoreAnimation framework to
          provide animated backgrounds and menu transitions.

        - Wrote an iPhone application which simulated a Magic 8 Ball.
          The application makes use of the accelerometer to determine
          if the device is shook or if the device is flipped upside
          down.

Alaska Communications Systems
     Anchorage, Alaska
     Acting IP Engineer II (2003 - 2010)
     Primary responsibilities include maintaining SunOne Directory
     Servers, Apache servers, ProFTP servers, and legacy servers from
     acquired ISP.  Secondary responsibilities include writing internal
     applications for the ISP business unit and other departments as
     required.
        - Developed a modular system to act as a device manager for
          mobile devices for the ACS cellular network. The system uses
          information from the device and billing system to properly
          configure the device for its capabilities and service when an
          OTA request is initiated.

        - Developed a client library for the Clam AntiVirus Daemon and
          used the library to create a ProFTPd module for scanning
          files uploaded by subscribers.

        - Installed and maintained a Redmine ticketing system for
          tracking department projects and department escalations.

        - Developed a web portal that allows staff to provision virtual
          domains and allows subscribers to self-manage users within
          their respective domains.

        - Developed a session management system which authenticates and
          tracks subscribers.  The system allows multiple web
          interfaces to share a single session identifier for a
          subscriber, thus eliminating the need for the subscriber to
          present credentials to each interface.

        - Developed a provisioning system which allows multiple billing
          systems to provision services on shared LDAP entries.  This
          system allows an individual subscriber to have one shared set
          of credentials for services managed managed by different
          billing systems.

        - Wrote a library and client which implemented the Over-the-air
          Service Provisioning Protocol, a proprietary protocol
          developed by Logica intended to allow clients on TCP/IP
          networks to communicate with mobile phones.  The client is
          used by an IVR to activate new mobile phones and update
          Preferred Roaming Lists (PRL) of existing mobile phones.

        - Wrote miscellaneous web interfaces for managing MMS, WAP, and
          EVDO service provisioning.

        - Wrote a library and utility that creates NAM data blocks for
          either IS-683-A or IS-683-C compatible mobile phones.

        - Implemented and maintained a CVS server to manage software
          packages developed by IP Engineering.

        - Migrated CVS repositories to Git repositories and used
          git-cvsserver to provide legacy CVS support.
     Systems Administrator I (August 2001 - 2003)
     Primary responsibilities included maintaining DNS servers, iPlanet
     Messaging Servers, iPlanet Directory Servers, Apache servers,
     ProFTP servers, and legacy servers from acquired ISP.  Secondary
     responsibilities included writing simple utilities to assist
     support staff.
        - Using Bind 9, designed a DNS infrastructure which implemented
          split views and split horizons.

        - Developed Unix tools using Perl, Bash, and C to simplify
          server management and to assist technical support personnel.

        - Developed multiple Perl CGI interfaces which provided staff
          with controlled access to LDAP data and radius data.

        - Developed an iPlanet Messenger Express plug-in using CGI
          scripting and JavaScript. The plug-in added the ability for
          subscribers to manage e-mail filters. This involved writing a
          basic Sieve rule parser in JavaScript.

        - Completed a user audit of an acquired company's provisioning
          system against the company's billing database. Services were
          provisioned using Unix passwd and shadow files and the
          billing information was stored in MS SQL databases.

        - Planned and executed an upgrade of an iPlanet Messaging
          Server that served roughly 65,000 users. The upgrade
          including moving from a Sun 4400 to a Sun V880, moving the
          message store from NFS shares to local arrays, and upgrading
          the software from version 5.1 to version 5.2.  Detailed
          plans, time lines accurate to the minute, and proof of
          repetitive testing was provided to management prior to the
          actual upgrade.

        - Planned and executed the migration of an acquired ISP
          (MosquitoNet) consisting of roughly 6,000 users into ACS's
          ISP infrastructure.  This included coordinated e-mail, web,
          FTP, DNS, and radius migrations.

        - Implemented a FTP infrastructure that uses LDAP for
          authentication and supports virtual domains.  Created custom
          LDAP schema to support infrastructure.

        - Developed a system that uses data from LDAP and local
          templates to dynamically provision and re-provision virtual
          domains.

        - Was primary administrator for DNS servers, iPlanet Messaging
          Servers, LDAP servers, and Unix web servers of the ISP
          business unit.
